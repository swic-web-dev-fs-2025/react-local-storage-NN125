## 13-1 Reflection

### Template Repair

I had a sneaking suspicion this was going to be a part of the assignment considering the fact that Tailwind didn't work for me while working on that unneeded custom app. I also didn't realize it went deeper than tailwind. Honestly I also find it insane that the Vite + React repo ignores the VS Code files by default.

Anyway, after fixing up some of the problems, removing unneeded things, and getting Tailwind imported to the CSS properly, I was able to to use the Tailwind classes again. I had no idea how much I missed it. I did go ahead and add a bunch of Tailwind classes to the Todo list branch's `app.jsx` since there were no custom classes listed in the CSS files anymore. It's definily much quicker to add Tailwind classes than making custom ones in a stylesheet. With that said, old fashioned custom classes made things a lot cleaner to look at in my `button-state` branch. I do wanna re-learn how to make [reusable custom classes with Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles) at some point, just to make things a little cleaner to look at, but doing things how we've been doing this whole semester has been working out fine.
